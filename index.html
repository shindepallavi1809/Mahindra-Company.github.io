            <h2>Mahindra Recruitment Process for Freshers</h2>
            <p>Mahindra conducts recruitment process every year to select new candidates. The Microsoft<br>Recruitment 
                Process consists of 3 rounds. These are as follows:<br><br>
                <strong> 1. Written and online test<br>2.Technical Interviews<br>3. HR Interview </strong><br><br>
                The Microsoft recruitment process is pretty the same as others. It hires through two ways:<br><br>
                <strong>1. On-campus recruitment drives<br>2. Off-campus recruitment process</strong><br><br>
                In case of off-campus Microsoft recruitment process, the two platforms they invite applications<br>
                from are, their own website and LinkedIn where they post job openings, and referrals.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>On-Campus Recruitment</h2>
            <p>In this process, there are 4 rounds.<br><br>
                <strong>1. Online Aptitude round<br>
                 2. Essay Writing Round<br>
                 3. Technical Round<br>
                 4. HR Round</strong><br><br>
                The Mahindra Recruitment Process starts with an online Aptitide test which consists of two<br>
                questions, and you will be given 60 minutes to answer them.<strong>Check Mahindra Placement Papers<br>
                for a detailed test pattern information.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Some of the commonly asked questions are as follows:</strong><br><br>
                  &#8226; Given a rotated sorted integer array, Please find the position of a given key within the rotated<br> array. Return - 1 if given key not found.<br>
                  &#8226; Given a binary search tree and a node, find the inorder successor of the node in the binary<br> search tree.<br><br>

                    The second round will be the written round. Here you will have to answer one question and the<br>
                    allotted time is 60 minutes.<br><br>

                    <strong>The most commonly asked question is as follows:</strong><br><br>
                    &#8226; Write the algorithm and the code of that to generate the power set of a given set (either of<br> iterative or recursive version would be okay)<br><br>

                    Once the candidates clear this, they will have to go through three technical interview rounds.There<br>
                    will not be any separate HR interview as they cover those questions also in one among the three<br>
                    technical interviews.
                    <strong>Get an understanding of the type of Microsoft Interview Questions asked previously.</strong>

                    <p><strong>These are some of the commonly asked questions during the technical interviews:</strong><br><br>
                      &#8226; You are given a sorted integer array, create a height-balanced binary search tree.<br>
                      &#8226; You have a linked list and two integers, a and b, modify the linked list such that you retain first<br>
                         a nodes, then delete b nodes, then retain a nodes and so on.<br>
                         &#8226; Explain the difference between the process and thread.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Off-Campus Recruitment</h2>
            <p>In case of off-campus Mahindra recruitment process, you can either apply through their job<br>
                postings on their website or LinkedIn, or through a referral.<br><br>

                The recruiters will sort the applications and the resumes. If you have been shortlisted from those,<br>
                you will be asked to attend the technical interwive, or the interview will happen over a phone call if<br>
                you are not from the same city.<br><br>
            
                The questions asked in the Off-campus interviews are also the same as those asked in the<br>
                on-campus recruitment.<br><br>
                <strong>Most frequently asked questions are:</strong><br><br>
                &#8226; Design a class for storing incidents in a calendar, which can repeat every specified number of<br>
                 days (say every week, every 15 days, etc). And write a method to return all the incidents<br> between a start date and an end date.<br>
                 &#8226; Given a Binary Tree, you have to find the node in such a way that its sub-tree is the largest<br>
                sized (in terms of the number of nodes) binary search tree.<br><br> Again, there will not be a separate HR interview. It will happen along with the Technical interviews.
